            <h3>What is it?</h3>
            <p>
                Not everything that Glitters is Gold, you may be wondering what it is, I’ll tell you. 
            <br> This is an album, EP or whatever, by my friend Impul$e.
            <br> He released it in the month of February and since then, I’m yet to hear anything as beautiful.
            <br> This page is a tribute from me, not written by the artist, but rather an expression of what I feel about this guy’s music. 
    <p>He’s got a great personality and that is reflected in his art.
            <br> My personal favourite song is the 3rd song – Audacious. 
    This is not the first album he has delivered for us, there is a lot more on his <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-763063695/tracks"><strong>soundcloud</strong></a>, and this is all shared in the discography.
            <br> Not Everything that Glitters is Gold, you may wondewr what this is

            <h3> Album description</h3>
           <p>My opinion on what this album means, is a summation of the youth in our times. 
            <br>“Not everything that glitters is gold”, that’s just it, we see our lives as a joyful experience on a day to day basis while admiring what seems to be the greener grass. 
            <br> The question really is, is it all gold?
            <br> Track number one, tell me what you what, outlines the fact that our generation is not straightforward more especially when it comes to love and hook-ups.
            <br> Track 2, self-explanatory we all have our pleasures and desires that keep us going, and for Impul$e, undeniably is mixing hot songs for us. 
            <br> Track 3, my fav, extends track 1 and 2, 
                Being straightforward in what we want with a mixture of how we all want to fulfil our inner pleasure, that of Love.
           <br> I’ll let you decide how the rest of the album makes you feel. Give it a try!</p>

            <h3>About March 11</h3>
            <p> One of the most beautiful nights….
             <br> We attended a listening party for the album. A few artists performed before he took centre stage.
             <br> The night was magnificent, friends and family got together to appreciate the good fruits of Impul$e’s labour. 
             <br>I had never seen as many people celebrating local music in that manner. 
             <br> The most beautiful thing is, we were not just vibing with him because he is our friend, but because the music was so good.
             <br> Have a look at the pictures taken that night, credit goes to Vinies Vision.
